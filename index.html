            <h1>Dhaka City</h1>
            <h2>Capital of Bangladesh</h2>
            <p>Dhaka, also spelled Dacca, city and capital of Bangladesh. It is located just north of the Buriganga
                River, a channel of the Dhaleswari River, in the south-central part of the country. Dhaka is
                Bangladesh’s most populous city and is one of the largest metropolises in South Asia. Dhaka’s name is
                said to refer to the dhak tree, once common in the area, or to Dhakeshwari (“The Hidden Goddess”), whose
                shrine is located in the western part of the city. Although the city’s history can be traced to the 1st
                millennium CE, the city did not rise to prominence until the 17th century, when it served as the capital
                of the Muslim Mughal dynasty of Bengal province (1608–39 and 1660–1704). It was the centre of a
                flourishing sea trade, attracting English, French, Armenian, Portuguese, and Dutch traders.</p>
