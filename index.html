            <h1>Dhaka City</h1>
            <h2>Capital of Bangladesh</h2>
            <p>Dhaka, also spelled Dacca, city and capital of Bangladesh. It is located just north of the Buriganga
                River, a channel of the Dhaleswari River, in the south-central part of the country. Dhaka is
                Bangladesh’s most populous city and is one of the largest metropolises in South Asia. Dhaka’s name is
                said to refer to the dhak tree, once common in the area, or to Dhakeshwari (“The Hidden Goddess”), whose
                shrine is located in the western part of the city. Although the city’s history can be traced to the 1st
                millennium CE, the city did not rise to prominence until the 17th century, when it served as the capital
                of the Muslim Mughal dynasty of Bengal province (1608–39 and 1660–1704). It was the centre of a
                flourishing sea trade, attracting English, French, Armenian, Portuguese, and Dutch traders.</p>

                <h1>Chittagong</h1>
                <h2 class="orange-color">2000-Present</h2>
                <p>Chittagong’s fine natural harbour was known to the Mediterranean world from the early Common Era and
                    to
                    Arab sailors by the 10th century. It was called Porto Grande by Portuguese and Venetian voyagers and
                    was
                    described by João de Barros in 1552 as “the most famous and wealthy city of the Kingdom of Bengal.”
                    It
                    has been generally identified with the city of Bengala described by early Portuguese and other
                    writers.
                    Conquered by the Muslims in the 14th century, Chittagong passed to the Arakanese in the next
                    century.
                    The piratical raids of the Arakanese and their Portuguese mercenaries led to the dispatch of a
                    strong
                    force by Shaista Khan, the Mughal governor (nawab) of Bengal, who in 1666 occupied the region.
                    Chittagong was ceded to the British East India Company in 1760.</p>
